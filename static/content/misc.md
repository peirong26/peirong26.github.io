## A little history ~
I was born in Ganzhou, China, in the year of Ox. My hometown is well-known for its hundred-year old banyan trees (榕树) along the Gan River. Banyan's seeds typically germinate in a crack and their roots seek out water deep underground. This is where my first name "沛榕" came from, with my parents' wish for me to keep eyes on the stars, while feet on the ground.

## About color ~
Green is always my favorite color. I realized it since I was a little girl, and there is no second choice in my mind.

## About Guzheng ~

I started playing Guzheng (a Chinese traditional instrument) since age 4, and I passed the Professional level-10 certificate with “Distinction” at age 9. I held my personal Guzheng concert when I was 10.  I was also the only player in Jiangxi Province, including amateurs and professionals, entering the final round of 2007 CCTV (China Central Television) Traditional Chinese Musical Instrument Contest. 

Now I am a member of Duke Music Ensemble, we practice together every week. I was so fortunate to meet friends here in the U.S. with same love in Chinese traditional music. We were also invited to perform at Duke's Chinese New Year's Gala in 2019.
