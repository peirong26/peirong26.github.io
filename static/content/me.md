## Hi there ~

My name is **Peirong Liu (刘沛榕)**, I am a 3rd year PhD student in Computer Science at [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Marc Niethammer](https://biag.cs.unc.edu/). Before this, I received my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/), where I graduated with class rank 1/305, and was awarded the President's List, National Fellowship, Baogang Fellowship, and Outstanding Graduate in Shanghai, China.

My research interests center on machine learning, computer vision and medical imaging. My recent research include:
- Exploring physics-constrained, PDE-integrated algorithms for understanding real-word transport (especially fluid flow and mass diffusion) time-series
- Fluid flow simulation, lesion detection and localization.
