## Hi there ~

My name is **Peirong Liu (刘沛榕)**, I am a 3rd year PhD student in Computer Science at [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Marc Niethammer](https://biag.cs.unc.edu/). Before this, I received my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/), where I graduated with class rank 1/305, and was awarded the President's List, National Fellowship, Baogang Fellowship, and Outstanding Graduate in Shanghai, China.

My research interests center on machine learning, computer vision and medical imaging. 
- **light/dark mode**, depending on your preferences

So, there you have it... enjoy!
